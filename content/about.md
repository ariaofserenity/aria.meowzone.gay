My name is Aria, last name redacted :3. I am a pansexual and polyamorous non binary trans catgirl who loves video games, tech, cooking and women. And I am very cringe. Also aspiring to do gamedev someday.

I am terminally obsessed with Final Fantasy XIV, but here are some of my favorite games/series:

```
* Dark Souls
* Umineko
* Xenoblade
* Mega Man X
* Final Fantasy XIV
* Ace Attorney
* Trails
* Fire Emblem
* Any kind of 3d platformers like Donkey Kong 64!!!!!!!
```

I'm also a big enjoyer of tech, I work as a linux sysadmin. I won't go too much in-depth about this here in case I want to make some blog posts but we'll see. :3
