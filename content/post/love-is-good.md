Today I had a date with a wonderful sheep girl that I've been getting along with for a few months now.
<br>

It feels like we hit it off really well and bonded over similar mental illnesses we've been suffering through. 
Some may say that dating someone with similar mental illnesses as you do may be detrimental, but I think in this case, it's been very beneficial.
I feel like she helps me a lot with my issues, and I do the same back at her, and we're both making sure we don't end up growing codependent.
As you know, I'm polyamorous, so codependency wouldn't exactly work for me.

<br>

Tangent aside, I started really caring for her the more we talked and I realized that I was crushing really hard. And then I found out that she liked me too, that was really surprising!
I asked her out today and we are now girlfriends. :3

<br>

I don't have much else to say, I'm looking forward to what the future holds with her. I do believe it'll be very fun and full of love, though. <3
