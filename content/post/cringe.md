Hi!! This is my first post. This is mainly serving as a test as I am unfamiliar with hugo and how risotto works. 

I guess I could talk about my week?

Well first, I am moving out!! It's been very stressful as it's the first time I'm going to live pretty much on my own, with my name being the only one on the lease. I even had to buy appliances, and gosh are these expensive. 

I'm really looking forward to living on my own though. Not being tied down to any roommate's rules and being able to make my own. The whole apartment being "my space".

Oh, and also, yknow, being able to invite over my girlfriends so I can kiss them, meow :3

Anyway that's all for today. o/
